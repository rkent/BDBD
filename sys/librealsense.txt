Default installs of librealsense from Intel sources are compiled with CUDA support, but for some reason
this is not working with the SR305 camera. (https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/6373)

On the bdbd system, compile librealsense from source as follows
(see https://github.com/jetsonhacks/installRealSenseSDK/blob/master/buildLibrealsense.sh)

1)  clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git
2)  cd librealsense
3)  mkdir build
4)  cd build
5)  disconnect all realsense cameras
6)  install any required dependencies
7)  cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=true -DFORCE_LIBUVC=true -DBUILD_WITH_CUDA=false -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=bool:true
8)  make -j4
9)  sudo make install
10) add to .bashrc:
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib
