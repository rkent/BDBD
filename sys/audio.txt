I had considerable trouble getting audio to work properly with systemd. This is an overview, as I remember it,
of what I needed to do.

The underlying issue is that espeak-ng uses pulseaudio. But pulseaudio tends to grab hold of audio devices and make them
unavailable to others.

The solution was to run a pulseaudio server at startup, with --system. This can now be shared.

But additional tweaks:

1)  All users touching this must be added to the pulse-access group, including root, pulse, and any users
    (like beedee or kent)
2)  The systemd services beedee.service and pulseaudio.service are included in the repo. These must be copied to
    /etc/systemd/system. Then sudo systemctl enable beedee, sudo systemctl enable pulseaudio.
3)  Even with beedee starting after pulseaudio, there is not enough time for pulseaudio to grab
    the ReSpeaker usb device. To solve this, I added a delay in main.py before the modules get loaded
    that make use of audio.
4)  Also, pulseaudio must be configured so that the default device is the ReSpeaker. This was done by adding
    these lines to the end of /etc/pulse/default.pa:

    set-default-sink alsa_output.usb-SEEED_ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array__UAC1.0_-00.analog-stereo
    set-default-source alsa_output.usb-SEEED_ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array__UAC1.0_-00.analog-stereo.monitor

5)  copy sys/60-respeaker.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d
